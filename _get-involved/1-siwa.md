#### Join the Family of Tech-Savvy Seniors!<br> 

Do you surprise your peers and family with your tech-savvy skills, or know anyone with a passion to help fellow seniors go digital? If that sounds like you, nominate yourself or your friend to be a Silver Infocomm Wellness Ambassador (SIWA)! 

SIWAs are seniors, aged 50 years and above, recognised for their active IT lifestyle and their efforts in inspiring and encouraging their peers to use infocomm technology to enhance their lifestyle, e.g. social networking, blogging and e-banking. SIWAs come from different backgrounds, but all of them have a burning passion to help other seniors embrace technology.

Over the years, there has been a growing community of seniors going digital and embracing a digital lifestyle. As more seniors become digitally ready, we hope that they too, can inspire their peers to use technology to benefit their daily living. 

The Silver Infocomm Wellness Ambassador programme is an initiative by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and the People’s Association Active Ageing Council (PA AAC).<br>
